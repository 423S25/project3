    <h2>Product Info</h2>
    <p>The product is a staff intranet page that will provide links to various resources within the HRDC organization. The webpage should be easy to navigate and have important and new updated information easily accessible. Near the top will be a header containing commonly used resources such as a link to the webpage used to fill out time sheets and other links accessed on a regular basis. We plan to use Plone as the framework.</p>
    
    <p>The webpage will also provide a news section where admin users can place new pieces of information as it becomes relevant to users.</p>
    
    <p>There will be a document search feature on the webpage that allows users to navigate documents that are now stored in the HRDC Google Drive folder. This search feature would use tags for certain document types to promote the easier finding of documents. For example: A "timesheet" tag for timesheets so that they are easily found within the whole of HRDC's document array.</p>
    
    <p>The webpage will also provide different tabs for different levels of employees such as volunteer, staff, and admin.</p>
    
    <p>Admin users should have a login feature that allows them to edit the page and make changes to content.</p>
